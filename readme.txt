Please note: I am well aware that the software shall not persist the user data between runs and that the data shall only be stored in memory while the software is running. I just implemented a text file that will store all the values the user will input and the application will read from the text file and once the user presses the exit button, the text file will automatically clear. 


INTRODUCTION
--------------------------

This application is for people that are interested in knowing how much they will have left over after purchasing a house or renting an accomodation and taking out a vehicle loan. This application consists of a different windows which will  have different contents written on it for the user to pick insert certain values Like the first window will allow the user to start running the application and the second window will allow the user to enter income values and so on. When the user presses the next button the application will keep moving from one window to another. Once users enter the required values, the application will keep storing it on a textfile in which it will read the information from at a later stage of the application when calculating. Once the user now reaches the calculate window, the system will then calculate everything and display everything including the amount of money that the user will have left at the end of the month. This is a very useful application for people that want to make sure of their finances before commiting to certain expenses and decisons. 



FEEDBACK
------------------

After receiving my marks from part 2, I realised that I learnt alot from the lectures feedback from part one which is why I obtained 100% for part two, which is why I hadnt gotten any feedback either than "Excellent" which pushed me to put in alot of work in this final POE.
